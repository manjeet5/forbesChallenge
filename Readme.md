#ForbesChallenge - Vanilla JS

## Functionality available in the app
- Retrieve a list of at least 50 images using flickr api and display them as thumbnails on a page
- Paginate thumbnails by 10 thumbnails per page
- When clicking on an image it should display in a modal.

## Approach
This project has been written in vanilla javascript. The DOM model API  was utilised to design the interactive experience for the end user. Additionally, the pagination logic has been built from scratch in the project. The ES6 syntax was transpiled using Babel and Webpack.

## Test environment - Work in Progress
The test environment has been setup. However, the code is not production ready as of yet, logic needs to added in the test case descriptions to ensure the code can withstand the tide of interesting scenarios;

## Steps to run the project
- Download the build folder
- Open index.html file in chrome browser
